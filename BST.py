#Binary Search Trees are a non-linear data structure.
#They consist of a root node and zero, one or two children where the children can again have 0,1, or 2 nodes as their children and so on
#In most cases, the time complexity of operations on a BST, which include, lookups, insertions and deletions, take O(log N) time
#Except for the worst case, where the tree is heavily unbalanced with all the nodes being on one side of the tree.
#In that case, it basically becomes a linked list and the time complexities go up to O(n)

#Lets implement an unbalanced Binary Search Tree first
#We will need a node class to store information about each node
#It will store the value(data) and the pointers to its left and right children
